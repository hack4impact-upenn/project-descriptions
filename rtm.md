    problem: >
        Until now, all merchant-vendor interactions have taken place offline. Our goals are to: Introduce greater transparency into the merchant-vendor market by making all vendor listings and prices available to merchants; Allow smaller vendors to be easily discovered; Discourage artificially high prices; and Make merchant-vendor interactions more efficient. We can do this by: Making all vendor listings and prices available to merchants; Providing separate accounts for vendors, merchants, and administrators; and Providing flexibility to constantly update product listings, invoices, and addition of new merchants and vendors into the community.

    features:
        - "Vendors: Create their own business profiles with contact information, address, business description, payment preferences"
        - "Vendors: Review Accept, Reject orders received from merchants. Email coming soon"
        - "Vendors: Post listings to the site with: Description, Cost per Unit, Availability"
        - "Merchants: Filter and Search Listings by price range"
        - "Merchants: Store Favorite Items"
        - "Merchants: Add Listings to Shopping Cart"
        - "Merchants: Checkout to receive e-mail consisting of invoices for each individual vendor in order to complete transactions offline"
        - "Merchants: View invoice history"
    technologies:
        - Flask
        - SQL
        - Semantic-UI
    technical_challenges:
        - The bulk upload work required lots of handling of different input data formats. Many edge cases were tried and tested.
        - Most of the functionality had been implemented, but we had yet to have vendors or merchants use the app. Their testing provided useful input for changes in the app.
    impact: >
        The purpose of the project is to allow and cultivate more local farmers, small "mom and pop vendors who would normally not be able to be a provider without a medium to reach all merchants in the market. By inviting these smaller vendors into bring locally grown, fresher products to market. Additionally it will give all of our merchants choices and allowing us to become more competitive for the Market as well as  to continue to give our customers the best choices.
