      description: >
          AsylumConnect is an incorporated nonprofit startup creating the first website and mobile app to feature an online, 
          centralized database of service providers for LGBTQ asylum seekers in the U.S. The AsylumConnect catalog will help 
          persecuted LGBTQ people find fundamental human needs resources upon their arrival in the U.S.

project:
    problem: >
        AsylumConnectâ€™s current resource verification model is a bottleneck, as volunteers must search for and independently 
        verify resources for each city that the organization expands into. In addition, volunteers are not (all) members of 
        our target community, and therefore not the best-equipped to verify whether or not a resource is LGBTQ-friendly, 
        asylum seeker-friendly, etc. By allowing community members to tag, verify, endorse, and report resources, AsylumConnect 
        will empower its niche and highly marginalized community while also keeping members as safe as possible.
    features:
        - Dynamic resource database with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) capabilities
        - Automated form for resource submission, editing & reporting that publishes publication requests to the admin console
        - "Admin console" for managing, editing, approving or rejecting resource submissions
        - Searching resources by location (e.g., Select a City - Philly / Seattle)
        - Basic data integrity & privacy (minimize collection of identifying user information)
        - Basic Google Analytics to track custom user actions
        - (Looking ahead) Better resource geospatial visualization - geolocation, directions, Google Street View
        - (Looking ahead) Ability to endorse features
        - (Looking ahead) When submitting a resource, check if resource already exists (de-duping)
        - (Looking ahead) Being able to sort resources by proximity
    technologies:
        - Python
        - Flask (for web application microframework)
        - SQLAlchemy (for databases)
        - Bootstrap (for responsive, mobile first framework for HTML, CSS, and JS)
        - JQuery

    impact: >
        Upon arrival to the U.S. from countries where they are persecuted because of their sexual orientation or gender 
        expression, LGBTQ asylum seekers often have nowhere to go, no social support, and no legal right to work - many end up 
        homeless. AsylumConnect strives to rectify this situation by assisting asylum seekers in locating and obtaining 
        lifesaving resources. This simple idea has the potential to benefit an estimated 300,000 LGBTQ asylum seekers.
