project:
    problem: >
        â€œEvery semester, non-profits ask us to develop a webapp to map resources for their organization or target audience. Maps4All generalizes this common problem into a customizable platform for any non-profit to input their resources and details. In Winter 2017, we completed the maps4all platform and deployed it for the [Juvenile Law Center and the Penn School of Policy and Practice](http://hack4impact.org/projects/m4a-jlc-sp2)."
    features:
        - Ability to search location and search resources by name
        - Ability to filter resources by multiple criteria
        - Ability to suggest new resources and edits to existing resources
        - Ability to rate/review resources
        - Admin-editable static pages to display important non-mappable information
        - Mobile-responsive interface
        - Admin console to add, delete or edit resources
        - Admin ability to bulk upload resources through CSV
    technologies:
        - Flask (main Python web application framework)
        - Handlebars (create JS templates for displaying resources)
        - Google Maps API (mapping resources)
        - Papaparse (parsing CSV files of resources)
    technical_challenges:
        - "Allowing for bulk uploading of resources through CSV: accommodating potentially large files and flexibility in being able to handle both reseting all data as well as updating"
        - Defining and then implementing ways for users to be able to do more detailed searches for resources by filtering
    impact: >
        The desired effect is to magnify our impact by simplifying the process of building mapping webapps for nonprofits.
