    problem: >
        In Philadelphia county, 22% of residents are food-insecure. While there are food assistance programs -- including food pantries, soup kitchens, and senior meal sites -- available to Philadelphians, such resources may be difficult for those in need to learn about or find.
    features:
        - intuitive map-based interface that visitors use to search for food resources by zip code
        - visitors can also search by types of resources
        - visitors can also search by advanced options
        - suite of administrative functions that will allow the FPAC to easily add and update food resources and other content on the website
        - managers of food resources within Philadelphia can submit their food resource’s information for inclusion in the website’s database
    technologies:
        - Flask (for web appl framework)
        - Foundation (for front-end)
        - SQLAlchemy (for database)
        -jQuery (for writing easier JavaScript)
        - gmaps.js (for map)
        - CKEditor.js (for web-based HTML text editor) 
        - Dropzone.js (for drag'n'drop file uploads)
        - Remodal (for pop-up modals)
    technical_challenges:
        - Our client, the Philadelphia Food Policy Advisory Council (FPAC), tackled this problem by creating the Food Resources Toolkit, a comprehensive guide to food resources in Philadelphia. Our task was to adapt the Food Resources Toolkit for the web -- to develop a central web-based tool where individuals can find all food resources that are available within their zip code. Our client also emphasized the need for the website to be easily updatable with new or updated food resources and information.

        We hope that Philly Food Finder will be a great asset to FPAC and the greater Philadelphia community
